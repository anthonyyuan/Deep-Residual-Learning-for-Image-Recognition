#Residual network implementation

##Original Residual newtork(http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1)
original residual network implementation with torch
20_plain, 20_res, 54_plain, 54_res are implemented using CIFAR-10
Yields the same performance as the paper
Basic residual block design and shortcut option A is used
